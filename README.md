# PayPal Template Gallery Extension

**Project Status:** === __Incomplete__ ===


Okay, so essentially what this is, is this is a fork from [Jake Hamblins Community Template](https://github.com/Jekeltor/communitytemplate)

I essentially am just removing everything in it, except the gallery page. I am also reworking some of the php code here, to get it to work correctly with his PayPal template.

---

So a quick run-down:

- I am taking the gallery from his [Community Template](https://github.com/Jekeltor/communitytemplate)
- Reworking it to work correctly with his PayPal Template
- Releasing it here, with some instructions, aswell as the credits.

---

Under the circumstances [Jake Hamblin](https://jakehamblin.com) decides to relist the Community Template for a price on his site, or he decides to disallow forks from the [repository](https://github.com/Jekeltor/communitytemplate) I will gladly remove / private this repository :]
